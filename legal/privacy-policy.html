        <p>We may serve advertisements, and also allow third-party ad networks, including third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Site.

        <h2>California Resident Rights</h2>
        <p>If you are a California resident, you have the rights set forth in this section. Please see the “Exercising Your Rights” section below for instructions regarding how to exercise these rights. Please note that we may process Personal Data of our customer’s end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to our customers. If we are processing your Personal Data as a service provider, you should contact the entity that collected your Personal Data in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.</p>
        <p>If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy and you are a California resident, the portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following rights apply to you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@suaviit.com" target="_blank">legal@suaviit.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>Access</h2>
        <p>You have the right to request certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Data over the past 12 months. In response, we will provide you with the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The categories of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li>
            <li>The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected.</li>
            <li>The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your Personal Data.</li>
            <li>The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data.</li>
            <li>The specific pieces of Personal Data that we have collected about you.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>If we have disclosed your Personal Data to any third parties for a business purpose over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data shared with each category of third party recipient. If we have sold your Personal Data over the past 12 months, we will identify the categories of Personal Data sold to each category of third party recipient.</p>

        <h2>Deletion</h2>
        <p>You have the right to request that we delete the Personal Data that we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your Personal Data to provide you with our services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. If your deletion request is subject to one of these exceptions, we may deny your deletion request. </p>

        <h2>Exercising Your Rights</h2>
        <p>To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request that (1) provides your first name, last name, company, and email address to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a “Valid Request.” We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.</p>

        <p>We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.</p>

        <p>You may submit a Valid Request using the following methods:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Email us at: <a href="mailto:legal@suaviit.com" target="_blank">legal@suaviit.com</a></li>
            <li>Submit a form at this address: <a href="https://suaviit.com/#contact" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://suaviit.com/#contact</a></li>
        </ul>
        </br>
        <p>You may also authorize an agent (an “Authorized Agent”) to exercise your rights on your behalf. To do this, you must provide your Authorized Agent with written permission to exercise your rights on your behalf, and we may request a copy of this written permission from your Authorized Agent when they make a request on your behalf.</p>

        <h2>Personal Data Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In</h2>
        <p>We will not sell your Personal Data, and have not done so over the last 12 months. To our knowledge, we do not sell the Personal Data of minors under 16 years of age. </p>

        <h2>We Will Not Discriminate Against You for Exercising Your Rights Under the CCPA</h2>
        <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. We will not deny you our goods or services, charge you different prices or rates, or provide you a lower quality of goods and services if you exercise your rights under the CCPA. However, we may offer different tiers of our services as allowed by applicable data privacy laws (including the CCPA) with varying prices, rates or levels of quality of the goods or services you receive related to the value of Personal Data that we receive from you.<strong> </strong></p>

        <h2>Other State Law Privacy Rights:</h2>

        <h2>European Union and United Kingdom Data Subject Rights:</h2>
        
        <p><strong>EU and UK Residents</strong></p>
        <p>If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom (“UK”), Lichtenstein, Norway or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation or the UK General Data Protection Regulation (collectively, the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data.  </p>

        <p>For this section, we use the terms “Personal Data” and “processing” as they are defined in the GDPR, but “Personal Data” generally means information that can be used to individually identify a person, and “processing” generally covers actions that can be performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure. Suavi IT will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the Site.</p>

        <p>If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the following applies to you, please contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@suaviit.com" target="_blank">legal@suaviit.com.</a></p>
        <p>Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customer’s end users or employees in connection with our provision of certain services to customers, in which case we are the processor of Personal Data. If we are the processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the controller), please contact the controller party in the first instance to address your rights with respect to such data.</p>

        <p>Where applicable, this section is intended to supplement, and not replace, the Company’s Privacy Policy. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Contractual Necessity:  We process the following categories of Personal Data as a matter of “contractual necessity”, meaning that we need to process the data to perform under our Terms of Use with you, which enables us to provide you with the Site. When we process data due to contractual necessity, failure to provide such Personal Data will result in your inability to use some or all portions of the Site that require such data. </li>
            <li>Legitimate Interest:  We process the following categories of Personal Data when we believe it furthers the legitimate interest of us or third parties: </li>

                <li>Web Analytics.</li>

                <li>Cookies and other tracking technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixel tags, SDKs, etc.), which are collected by Google, Marketo, 6Sense, Microsoft, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Bizible—i.e., service providers who assist us with marketing or promotional services related to how you interact with our Site.</li>
                <li>We may also de-identify or anonymize Personal Data to further our legitimate interests. </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

            <li>Corresponding with you.</li>
            <li>Providing customer support.</li>
            <li>Protecting you from fraud or security threats.</li>
            <li>Meeting legal requirements and enforcing legal terms.</li>

            <li>Other processing grounds: From time to time we may also need to process Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation, if it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or other data subjects, or if it is necessary for a task carried out in the public interest.</li>
        </ul>
