            <p>Hello, and welcome to Suavi IT's Cookie Policy ("Policy").</p>

            <p>The objective of this Policy is to provide you, as a user of Suavi IT’s services, with clear and accessible information about the cookies that Suavi IT uses, the role they play in helping us provide the best possible experience to you and the choices you have when it comes to your cookie settings.</p>

            <h2>1. What are cookies and other similar technologies:</h2>

            <p>Cookies are text files which are downloaded to your device when you visit a website. They are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user's device. You can find more information about cookies at: <a href="https://allaboutcookies.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> or <a href="https://youronlinechoices.eu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p>

            <p>The term cookie actually describes a range of technologies, including:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Pixel tags (transparent graphic images placed on a web page or in an email, which indicate that a page or email has been viewed)</li>
                <li>Device identifiers</li> 
                <li>Web storage used in desktop software or mobile devices</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We'll use the term cookie throughout this Policy to cover all of these technologies, but we'll make sure we provide you with clear details about them all so that you can make informed choices about your cookie settings.</p>

            <p>Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving your user experience. They can also help to ensure that ads you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>

            <p>There are a few different categories of cookies, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Session and persistent cookies.</li>
                <li>Session cookies - these are cookies which expire once you close your web browser.</li>
                <li>Persistent cookies - these are cookies which stay on your device for a set period of time or until you delete them.</li>
                <li>First-party cookies - these are cookies set by the website that you are visiting at that time, either by us, or by a third party at our request.</li>
                <li>Third-party cookies - these are cookies that are set by a party other than that of the website you are visiting. If you visit the Suavi IT website or use the Suavi IT Service and another party sets a cookie through that website this would be a third-party cookie.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Cookies also differ depending on the purpose they are used for, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strictly necessary cookies - These cookies are essential in order to enable you to use the features of our services, such as maintaining your web experience. Without these cookies, services you have asked for e.g., e-billing, cannot be provided. In summary, these cookies enable services you have specifically asked for and make using our services possible.</li>
                <li>Performance cookies - These cookies collect information about how visitors use our services, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies collect anonymous information on the pages visited. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how our services perform.Web analytics that use cookies to gather data to enhance the performance of a website fall into this category. For example, they may be used for testing designs and ensuring a consistent look and feel is maintained for the user. This category does not include cookies used for behavioral/targeted advertising networks.</li>
                <li>Functionality cookies - These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your username, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customize. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.These cookies remember choices you make to improve your experience. If the same cookie is used for retargeting they must be included in the ‘Targeting or advertising cookies’ category as well. It might also include cookies that are used to deliver a specific function, but where that function includes cookies used for behavioral/targeted advertising networks they must be included in the ‘Targeting or advertising cookies’ category as well as this category.</li>
                <li>Targeting or advertising cookies - These cookies are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisations.These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests.</li>
            </ul>
